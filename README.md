## Rules
### Stage 1
Participants forecast scores for all the games (48 games).

Points for correct predictions:
- 6 points for correctly predicting the game winner (if there is a winner) or the tie,
- 2 points for correctly predicting each team's goal count, contingent on correctly predicting the winner or tie,
- 5 points for correctly predicting each country advancing to the Round of 16.

Maximum points in Stage 1: 48 x 10 + 16 x 5 = 560 

### Stage 2
Participants forecast who advances in each game of Stage 2, (including winners in the final and in the 3rd place game).
All the predictions must be consistent across rounds.

Points for correct predictions:
- 10 for each country in the Quarter-Finals (8 countries),
- 10 for each country in the Semi-Finals (4 countries),
- 10 for each country in the Final (2 countries),
- 10 for the 3rd place,
- 25 for the champion.

Maximum points in Stage 2: 175

## Other participants
### Macaco (random)
- in stage 1, chooses goals at random with uniform probability on support `{0, 1, 2}`
- in stage 2, chooses team that advances at random, with equal probability

### Donald (wants to make America great again)
- in stage 1 he predicts that USA will always win. He doesn't really understand the mechanics of the game, so he chooses the score as 5-0 in favor or USA.
- because he doesn't really care about the rest of the world, he doesn't fill out the rest of the table. We fill in missing results with 0-0 and choose everything undeterminded by selecting the nation that voted most like Putin's Russia in the United Nations General Assembly.
- in any case, he will not accept the final result if he does not win.
