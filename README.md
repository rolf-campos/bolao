## Rules
### Stage 1
Participants forecast scores for all the games (48 games). Based on these predictions, the top two countries from each group that go to the Round of 16 are defined. In case of a tie for first or second place, where FIFA would have to make a draw, the Bol√£o participant will be prompted at the bottom of Stage 1 spreadsheet to select which country advances.

Points for Correct Predictions:
6 points for correctly predicting the game winner (if there is a winner) or the tie,
2 points for correctly predicting each team's goal count, contingent on correctly predicting the winner or tie,
3 points for correctly predicting each country advancing to the Round of 16,
2 point for correctly predicting the ranking of each country in its group.
Total Points Stage 1: 48*10 + 16*5 = 560 

### Stage 2
Participants forecast who advances in each game of Stage 2, (including winners in the final and 3rd place game).
All the predictions must be consistent across rounds. 

Points for Correct Predictions:
10 for each country in the Quarter-Finals (8 countries),
10 for each country in the Semi-Finals (4 countries),
10 for each country in the Final (2 countries),
10 for the 3rd place,
25 for the champion.
